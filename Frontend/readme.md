This is a typescript React App for displaying the current price of a CryptoCurrency from an initial invested amount, which indicates how much was gained/lost.

Run 
>npm install within the my-app folder.
The installation for react-fluid-animation might bug out, so install it using 
>npm install --save react-fluid-animation --force
Now Move the index.d.ts from the current folder to  my-app\node_modules\react-fluid-animation and place it there

Now it should be working as intendid using 
>npm start
